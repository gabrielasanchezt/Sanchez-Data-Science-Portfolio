# Sanchez Data Science Portfolio

## Purpose of This Portfolio

This repository highlights hands-on projects that reflect both the breadth and depth of my training in data science. These projects not only demonstrate technical skills—such as model development and data cleaning—but also reflect my ability to communicate insights clearly and build tools for non-technical users. My goal is to create work that is reproducible, interpretable, and impactful.

# Projects and Applications – At a Glance

## Unsupervised Machine Learning App
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gabrielasanchezt/Sanchez-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLUnsupervisedApp)
[Live App](https://sanchez-data-science-portfolio-2pdvkustkkj3kwupdwzbxb.streamlit.app/)

This interactive Streamlit application allows users to explore key unsupervised learning techniques including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Means Clustering, and Hierarchical Clustering. Users can upload their own datasets or use the built-in Iris dataset, customize hyperparameters, and visualize results with dynamic plots such as scatterplots, scree plots, dendrograms, and silhouette curves. This app emphasizes workflow integration—from data upload and preprocessing to model evaluation and interpretation.

## Supervised Machine Learning App
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gabrielasanchezt/Sanchez-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitapp)
[Live App](https://gabrielasanchezt-sanchez-data-science--mlstreamlitappapp-vgbda3.streamlit.app/)

This Streamlit-based app supports both classification and regression tasks using models like Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and more. Users can upload datasets, select target and feature variables, tune model parameters, and visualize performance using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and decision boundaries. The project highlights full-stack deployment of supervised learning models in an interactive environment.

## Tidy Data Project
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gabrielasanchezt/Sanchez-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Tidy_Data)

This project focuses on reshaping and cleaning a dataset of medalists from the 2008 Summer Olympics. Using pandas operations such as .melt() and .str.split(), the data is transformed into a tidy format—ensuring that each variable forms a column, each observation a row, and each type of observational unit a separate table. This work showcases my understanding of the tidy data framework and my ability to prepare real-world data for analysis.

## Palmer Penguins Classifier
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gabrielasanchezt/Sanchez-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic_streamlit.app)

A beginner-level classification project built around the Palmer Penguins dataset—commonly used as an alternative to the Iris dataset. This app uses scikit-learn to train a model predicting penguin species based on input features such as bill length, flipper length, and body mass. Deployed using Streamlit, the app demonstrates foundational skills in model training, evaluation, and user-facing application development.


## Goals

1. **Expand technical expertise** in applied machine learning, advanced analytics, and software development
2. **Build a strong professional portfolio** that illustrates problem-solving, innovation, and clarity of communication
3. **Apply data science methods** to real-world challenges with economic, social, or ethical significance
