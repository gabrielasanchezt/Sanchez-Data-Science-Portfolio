Description:
What the Tidy Data project entails:
This Tidy Data project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a dataset of Olympic athletes and their medal performances across different sports. The goal is to apply Tidy Data Principles to transform the data into a clean, structured format for easier analysis. The dataset includes athlete names, sports, and the medals they won (gold, silver, or bronze). I used Python to clean the data, reshape it, and create visualizations that help show trends in the medal counts across different athletes and sports.

How it complements the portfolio

Data Cleaning: I cleaned and reshaped the data, ensuring itâ€™s in a tidy, usable format.
Data Analysis: I analyzed the data to uncover insights about athletes and their performances.
Data Visualization: I created clear visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
Iâ€™ve improved my ability to work with real-world data, clean it for analysis, and present my findings in an understandable way using Python tools like Pandas and Matplotlib. It demonstrates my practical skills for any data-related roles.

What the ML Sreamlit App entails:
This app is an interactive machine learning tool built with Streamlit that predicts data. It takes user input (or a loaded dataset), performs data preprocessing, and allows real-time exploration of feature selection, model training, and evaluation using techniques like decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.

Working on this project deepened my understanding of the entire machine learning pipeline:
From cleaning and encoding raw data,
To feature engineering and model selection,
To interpreting model performance metrics like RMSE and RÂ².
It also reinforced key lessons about data leakage, handling categorical variables, and the importance of scaling and splitting data correctly to prevent overfitting.

How it complements portfolio:
Deploying models in a web interface using Streamlit, creating responsive visualizations with libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib, and letting users customize model parameters and explore outputs live.

By showcasing this project in my portfolio, I highlight:
My full-stack data science capabilities (from data to deployment),
My comfort with Python interactivity and UI frameworks,

## Goals
1. Learn about coding
2. Be able to enhance my professional profile
3. Showcase my personal projects and technical skills
