# Sanchez Data Science Portfolio

## About Me

My name is **Gabriela Sanchez**, and I am an international undergraduate student at the University of Notre Dame from Nicaragua. I am majoring in **International Economics (Portuguese Concentration)** with minors in **Data Science** and **History**, and I am a member of both the **Glynn Family Honors Program** and the **Balfour-Hesburgh Scholars Program**. I have a strong interest in research across economic, linguistic, and financial fields and a growing portfolio of applied data science projects.

## Technical Skills

- **Programming Languages:** Python, R  
- **Data Analysis Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Other Tools:** Streamlit, Git/GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, Excel  

## Purpose

This repository highlights my work in data science, showcasing hands-on projects that demonstrate my skills in data preprocessing, analysis, visualization, machine learning, and deployment. It reflects both academic exploration and practical applications that support my professional growth.

## Repository Structure

- `EDA/`: Exploratory data analysis projects  
- `Visualizations/`: Interactive and static data visualizations  
- `Models/`: Machine learning models and evaluation  
- `MLStreamlitapp/`: A full machine learning app with Streamlit  

## Featured Projects

### 1. Palmer Penguins Classifier  
**GitHub:** [Palmer Penguins Project](https://github.com/gabrielasanchezt/Sanchez-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic_streamlit.app)

A beginner-level project using the Palmer Penguins dataset to build a species classifier. This app was created to explore basic model building and Streamlit app deployment.

### 2. Tidy Data: Olympic Athletes  
**GitHub:** [Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/gabrielasanchezt/TidyData-Project)

**Description:**  
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a dataset of Olympic athletes and their medal performances across different sports. The primary objective was to apply tidy data principles to transform messy, real-world data into a structured format for effective analysis and visualization.

**Contribution to Portfolio:**  
- Demonstrates foundational data cleaning skills  
- Applies tidy data principles to enable better analysis  
- Produces clear visualizations that support interpretation of trends

### 3. Machine Learning Streamlit App  
**GitHub:** [ML Streamlit App](https://github.com/gabrielasanchezt/Sanchez-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitapp)  
**Live App:** [View App on Streamlit Cloud](https://gabrielasanchezt-sanchez-data-science--mlstreamlitappapp-vgbda3.streamlit.app/)

**Description:**  
This is an interactive machine learning application that allows users to upload their own dataset or choose from sample datasets. The app automatically identifies whether the task is classification or regression, enables hyperparameter tuning, and presents visual feedback using charts, performance metrics, and cross-validation results.

**Key Features:**  
- Dynamic classification vs. regression detection  
- Support for multiple supervised learning models  
- Real-time performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, MSE, RÂ²)  
- Hyperparameter tuning via an intuitive sidebar  
- Clean, responsive Streamlit interface with usage guidance  

**Contribution to Portfolio:**  
- Demonstrates full-stack ML capability from preprocessing to deployment  
- Emphasizes model interpretability and user-centered design  
- Highlights practical knowledge of scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and Streamlit

## Goals

1. Expand my technical and programming skills  
2. Build a professional portfolio that reflects my analytical abilities  
3. Apply data science principles to meaningful and relevant problems
