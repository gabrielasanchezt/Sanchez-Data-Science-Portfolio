# Sanchez Data Science Portfolio

## About Me

My name is Gabriela Sanchez, and I am an international undergraduate student at the University of Notre Dame from Nicaragua. I am majoring in **International Economics (Portuguese Concentration)** with minors in **Data Science** and **History**. I am a proud member of the **Glynn Family Honors Program** and the **Balfour-Hesburgh Scholars Program**, both of which support rigorous academic inquiry and leadership development.

My academic and professional interests lie at the intersection of economics, language, and data. Through this portfolio, I aim to demonstrate how computational tools can be applied to solve real-world problems, from exploring economic patterns to deploying accessible, interactive machine learning applications. My projects combine theory, statistical rigor, and strong visual storytelling.

## Technical Skills

* **Languages:** Python, R
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Frameworks & Tools:** Streamlit, Git/GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, Excel
* **Techniques:** Data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model selection, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, model deployment

## Purpose of This Portfolio

This repository highlights hands-on projects that reflect both the breadth and depth of my training in data science. These projects not only demonstrate technical skills—such as model development and data cleaning—but also reflect my ability to communicate insights clearly and build tools for non-technical users. My goal is to create work that is reproducible, interpretable, and impactful.

## At a Glance

You're right — GitHub-flavored Markdown has limited table formatting, and long descriptions or multiline cells don’t render well. Here's a simplified version of the “At a Glance” section, using bullet points instead of a table so it’s fully compatible with `README.md` display:

### 2. Tidy Data: Olympic Athletes

* **Dataset:** Olympic performance dataset with athlete demographics and medal counts.
* **Objective:** Clean and restructure messy data to explore trends in athlete performance, gender distribution, and sport-level patterns.
* **Approach:** Implemented tidy data principles (e.g., one variable per column, one observation per row), used pandas for reshaping, and visualized with matplotlib and seaborn.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Data wrangling, exploratory analysis, gender-based segmentation, country-wise comparisons, visual storytelling.
* **Impact:** Highlights ability to clean and structure complex real-world datasets to uncover meaningful trends.
