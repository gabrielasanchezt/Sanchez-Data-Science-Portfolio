## Professional Bio
International undergraduate student at Notre Dame from Nicaragua, pursuing a major in International Economics (Portuguese Concentration) with a double minor in Data Science and History. I am also a part of the Glynn Family Honors Program and Balfour-Hesburgh Scholars Program. I have a strong interest in research in economic, linguistic, and financial fields.
## Technical Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R
- **Data Analysis Tools**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Other Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git, Excel

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This repository showcases my data science projects, including exploratory data analysis, data visualizations, and machine learning models. Itâ€™s a collection of my work and progress in the field of data science.

## Structure
- `EDA/`: Contains exploratory data analysis projects.
- `Visualizations/`: Includes custom visualizations and dashboards.
- `Models/`: Showcases machine learning models and their applications.

## ðŸš€ Current Projects
1. **First Project**: Palmer's Penguins
2. **Second Project**: Tidy Project Portfolio LINK: [https://github.com/gabrielasanchezt/TidyData-Project/](https://github.com/gabrielasanchezt/TidyData-Project/)
Description:
What the Tidy Data project entails:
This Tidy Data project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a dataset of Olympic athletes and their medal performances across different sports. The goal is to apply Tidy Data Principles to transform the data into a clean, structured format for easier analysis. The dataset includes athlete names, sports, and the medals they won (gold, silver, or bronze). I used Python to clean the data, reshape it, and create visualizations that help show trends in the medal counts across different athletes and sports.

How it complements the portfolio

Data Cleaning: I cleaned and reshaped the data, ensuring itâ€™s in a tidy, usable format.
Data Analysis: I analyzed the data to uncover insights about athletes and their performances.
Data Visualization: I created clear visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
Iâ€™ve improved my ability to work with real-world data, clean it for analysis, and present my findings in an understandable way using Python tools like Pandas and Matplotlib. It demonstrates my practical skills for any data-related roles.

## Goals
1. Learn about coding
2. Be able to enhance my professional profile
3. Showcase my personal projects and technical skills
