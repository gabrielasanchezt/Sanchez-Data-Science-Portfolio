# Unsupervised Machine Learning Explorer

This directory contains a Streamlit-based interactive application that demonstrates unsupervised machine learning techniques including K-Means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Users can upload a custom dataset or work with a sample dataset (Iris) to explore clustering structure, dimensionality reduction, and model interpretability in a user-friendly interface.

---

## Overview

The Unsupervised Machine Learning Explorer is designed to support intuitive exploration of cluster patterns within multivariate datasets. The application guides users through the complete workflow, including:

* Data upload and inspection
* Missing value handling (mean imputation or row removal)
* Feature selection
* Standardization
* K-Means clustering with silhouette score evaluation
* Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering with dendrogram visualization
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and 2D plotting
* Elbow method to evaluate optimal number of clusters

---

## Features

* **Interactive File Upload**: Analyze your own CSV datasets or default to the Iris dataset.
* **Feature Selection**: Dynamically select numeric features for analysis.
* **Missing Value Handling**: Choose between mean imputation or dropping rows.
* **K-Means Clustering**: Evaluate cluster structure and silhouette scores.
* **Hierarchical Clustering**: Visualize data structure via dendrograms and cluster overlays.
* **PCA Visualization**: Reduce dimensions for easy 2D plot interpretation.
* **Elbow Method Plot**: Determine ideal cluster count based on inertia.
* **Download Results**: Export clustered data as a CSV file.

## Models and Methods

* **K-Means Clustering**: Partitioning method evaluated with silhouette scores.
* **Agglomerative Clustering**: Hierarchical model using selectable linkage criteria (ward, complete, average, single).
* **Principal Component Analysis**: Used to visualize clustering results in a 2D space.
* **Elbow Method**: A heuristic used to choose an appropriate number of clusters.
