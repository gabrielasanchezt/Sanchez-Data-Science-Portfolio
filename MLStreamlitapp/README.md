# 🔍 Supervised Machine Learning Streamlit App

A simple and interactive web application built with **Streamlit** that allows users to upload or select datasets, train supervised learning models, tune hyperparameters, and visualize performance metrics — all without writing a single line of code.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This application enables users to explore **classification** tasks using pre-built datasets or their own CSV files. Users can:

- Select a model: **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, or **K-Nearest Neighbors**
- Upload their dataset or choose from classic examples like Iris, Wine, or Breast Cancer
- Tune hyperparameters interactively using sidebar sliders and dropdowns
- Visualize results via accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and feature importance plots

Whether you're a beginner in data science or just looking to rapidly prototype ideas, this tool is designed to provide quick, no-code insights into model performance.
