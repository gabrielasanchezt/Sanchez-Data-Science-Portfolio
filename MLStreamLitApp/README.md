# üß† Supervised Machine Learning App (Streamlit)

Welcome to the Supervised Machine Learning App: an interactive and educational Streamlit web app where users can upload their own datasets or explore built-in sample datasets, train machine learning models, adjust hyperparameters, and evaluate results visually and intuitively.


## Project Overview

This app is designed to give users a hands-on experience with **supervised machine learning**. With just a few clicks, users can:
- Upload their own dataset (CSV)
- Choose from built-in datasets (Iris, Wine, Breast Cancer)
- Select a classification model (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or K-Nearest Neighbors)
- Tune hyperparameters interactively
- View performance metrics including Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curve (for binary classification)

## Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-streamlit-app.git
cd ml-streamlit-app
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

### 3. Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### ‚ñ∂4. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 5. Deployed Version

You can also try the live version on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/yourusername/ml-streamlit-app/main/app.py).



## App Features

### Model Selection

- **Logistic Regression**
  - Tune penalty (`l2`, `none`), regularization strength (`C`), and solver (`lbfgs`, `saga`).
  
- **Decision Tree**
  - Tune max depth, criterion (`gini`, `entropy`), splitter (`best`, `random`), and minimum samples per split.
  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - Tune number of neighbors (`k`), weights (`uniform`, `distance`), and distance metric (`Euclidean`, `Manhattan`).

### Visual Output

- **Accuracy Score**
- **Confusion Matrix** (with heatmap)
- **ROC Curve** and **AUC Score** (for binary classifiers)
- **Feature Importance** (for Decision Tree)
- **Pairplot** (optional for smaller datasets)
